It cross compiles and is relatively easy to pack. In contrast to other native C++ libraries like SFML, RAII is not included by default. However, while working with SFML I found that I ended up with my own RAII layer anyway. SDL2_gfx Homepage Easily mistaken for an actual part of SDL2. It is that conformity which makes it attractive. PhysFS Homepage This is the library used for abstracting the file system. The system is strongly inspired by the system used by Quake 3. It is also fantastic for mod support. boost_program_options Homepage Used to parse program options from command line or config file. Primarily used because I like the format for saland -h . There are other libraries that do the same but I prefer the boost option if it is available. boost (headers) Homepage For basic algorithms I turn to boost. Used tokenizer and predicate. It is big dependency in size but I find the number of dependencies to be more problematic than the size. Bundled Box2d Homepage This is used for the physics. Using physics in a top down game gives a feeling of pushing things around that I like. I include box2d as a bundled dependency. The reason is that Box2d does not guarantee compatibility between even versions. Even minor versions might break the API. b64 Homepage (Debian patches) Used for base64 encoding and decoding for the Tiled format. During development I got dependent on some of the Debian changes. There is an unmerged patch on the SalesForce project and without that patch everything breaks horribly. Buffer overflows are a major problem in C and b64 is very prone to them without the patch. utf8cpp Homepage The no-nonsense working version of UTF-8 for C++. The biggest problem with this library is that Linux distribution package it differently and MXE.cc does not pack it at all. Therefore the library is also bundled. rapidxml Homepage Used by the homemade tiled-library. This is a header only. I have experienced some version compatibility trouble while working with Cereal, so I embed a specific version. rapidjson Homepage Used by the common \"sago\" files shared with Block Attack - Rise of the Blocks. Bundled due to compatibility concerns found in Cereal. PlatformFolders Homepage My own library for handling access to Save games folders on different platforms. While this was designed with backwards compatibility in mind. I always assumed that it would get embedded.","title":"Libraries"},{"location":"development_info/libraries/#libraries","text":"Some of the dependencies and the justification for using them","title":"Libraries"},{"location":"development_info/libraries/#dependencies","text":"","title":"Dependencies"},{"location":"development_info/libraries/#sdl-2","text":"Homepage This is the foundation of all my C++ games.
